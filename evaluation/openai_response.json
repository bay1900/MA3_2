    "output": "For someone who is 30 years old and has a BRCA2 gene fault, the risk of developing breast cancer between ages 25 and 30 is approximately 1-2%. The risk of ovarian cancer by this age is generally low but tends to increase after age 40. Other cancers associated with BRCA2 mutations, such as male breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer, typically have risks that become more relevant at older ages beyond 30.  \n\nWhile the risk of breast cancer at your current age is relatively low, it is not zero, so regular surveillance and discussions about risk management with healthcare professionals or a genetic counselor are recommended. This can help ensure early detection and preventive measures if necessary.  \n\nIf you have further concerns or want tailored advice, seeking guidance from a genetic counselor or specialist is strongly advised.  \n\nHeading: Resources  \n- Detailed, age-specific risk data and management guidelines are often provided by genetic counseling services and oncology specialists.",

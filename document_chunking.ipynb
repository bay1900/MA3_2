However, RRBM is only known to reduce instances of breast cancer related death by around 3%.2,3\\n- It is important to know that breast reduction surgery does not reduce breast cancer risk as much as bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM).\\n- If you have had breast reduction or gender-affirming surgery, you should discuss your cancer risks and management with your specialist.\\n- SeeImpact of risk reducing mastectomyfor further considerations and recommendations before deciding about RRBM.\\nHeading: What you should know about Bilateral Mastectomy\\nRisk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy (RRBM) is recommended by age 40 years to optimise your reduction in breast cancer risk1RRBM involves surgery to remove the breast tissue and includes:\\n- Total mastectomy – this procedure allows removal of the most breast tissue by removing the skin surrounding the breast and the nipple and areola.\\n- Skin sparing mastectomy – this involves removing as much breast tissue as possible and the nipple and areola, while keeping the skin envelope over the breast. This allows the shape of your breast to be maintained if you choose to have a breast reconstruction.\\n- Nipple sparing mastectomy – this allows the skin around the breast and the nipple and areola to remain. It does not allow for removal of as much breast tissue as a total mastectomy, as some tissue is left behind the nipple.It is important to know that breast reduction surgery does not reduce breast cancer risk as much as bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM).\\n- If you have had breast reduction or gender-affirming surgery, you should discuss your cancer risks and management with your specialist.Depending on the type of surgery, you will likely be in hospital for 3 to 5 days; however allow up to 6 weeks before resuming your normal activities.\\n- RRBM is either performed at a public or private hospital.\\n- There are no costs when undergoing RRBM at a public hospital, however, there is a wait list.\\n- There may be shorter wait times at a private hospital, however there are costs involved.\\nThe decision for RRBM is a personal one and should be made in consultation with a specialist who can explain the risks and benefits to you.\\nHeading: RRBM Support\\n- It normal for people who have undergone RRBM to reduce their cancer risk to report challenges in decision making and after the surgery itself.\\n- SeeImpact of risk reducing mastectomyfor further information.\\nHeading: After RRBM\\nAs with all surgeries, there are potential associated complications, your surgeon will explain this to you in detail. It is not uncommon to require follow up after your surgery. The following is a list of potential complications associated with RRBM;\\n- Short-term\\n- Pain, tingling or numbness following surgery\\n- Infection and bleeding\\n- Longer-term\\n- Pain and discomfort in reconstructed breast\\n- Loss of sensitivity in nipple and areola\\n- Need for repeat surgeries\\n- Dissatisfaction with the change in appearance of your breasts\\nHeading: Reconstruction\\n- Some people to choose to weari a breast prosthesis fitted into a bra, or have a breast reconstruction (usually performed by a plastic surgeon).\\n- If you choose to have a breast reconstruction, this can be performed immediately at the time of your surgery, or it can be delayed. Reconstruction can be done using an implant or with your natural body tissue.\\nHeading: Wound care\\n- Immediately after surgery you will need to keep your wound taped for 1 to 2 weeks\\n- For the next two months you should massage the scars every day using any type of moisturising product.\\n- The scar will be pink and noticeable initially but massage will allow you to obtain the best possible result.\\nHeading: Activity\\n- For the first 6 weeks, you can use your arms for eating, dressing and showering, but only as much as is comfortable for you.\\n- When you start household activities again, begin with lighter duties first. Remember to pace yourself and take regular breaks. It is important to slowly build up your level of activity.\\n- Most people are advised not to drive for 4 weeks after their surgery, but this depends on the type of procedure.\\nHeading: Exercise\\n- Arm exercise post-surgery will help improve movement and ease the stiffness in your arms. It may also help with a faster recovery.\\n- The exercises will vary depending on whether you have had reconstruction or not at the same time as your RRBM.\\n- Ask your surgeon what exercises you can do and when to begin.\\nHeading: Risk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy\\nRisk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy (RRBM) is the most effective way to reduce your breast cancer risk but requires careful discussion with a specialist about advantages and disadvantages.1\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

Emotional adaptation is part of the process of coping with early menopause.\\nHeading: Surgical menopause\\n- Infertility - options regarding fertility preservation and IVF are available if you have not completed your family and can be discussed with a fertility specialist (SeeReproduction and Fertility)\\n- The effects of surgical menopause will vary for each individual and can range from hot flushes, sleep disturbance, vaginal dryness, changes in mood and interest and experience of sex.\\n- Severe symptoms may require a menopause specialist’s support and Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) until around age 50yrs.\\n- Early onset of menopause following surgery may increase your risk of heart disease and negatively affect bone health.\\n- It is important to maintain regular health checks with your doctor to monitor these impacts e.g. blood pressure checks and blood tests as needed\\nHeading: How you can manage menopausal symptoms\\nHeading: Bone and Heart Health\\n- There are lifestyle factors that can improve bone strength and other health impacts for information inOvarian Cancer Risk ReductionandLifestyle Factors\\n- Your doctor may suggest a bone density scan to measure your bone strength. This is a recommended scan if you undergo menopause before the age of 45 years so discuss this with your doctor if it has not been raised.\\n- All people are at an increased risk of heart disease and stroke after menopause\\n- You should avoid activities which increase your heart disease risk\\n- Stop smoking as this increases cancer risk and risk of osteoporosis and ischaemic heart disease (seeLifestyle Factors)\\n- Attain and maintain a healthy weight, being severely over- or under- weight increases your risk\\nHeading: Mood disturbance\\nIt is normal for menopause to impact on your mood. You may feel anxious, depressed, have low mood or mood swings. Whilst these mood changes are common, there are management options available.\\nPossible management options\\n- Consider cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to alleviate low mood or anxiety\\n- CBT aims to show you how your thoughts affect your mood and bring about positive changes in your quality of life. More info here:https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/cognitive-behaviour-therapy\\n- Consider HRT with your specialist in the short term (up to 5 years) after a discussion with you about the longer-term benefits and risks.\\nHeading: Hot flushes and night sweats\\n- This is the most common symptom reported by people during menopause.\\n- Commonly experienced by approximately 50% of people during menopause and 75% of postmenopausal people.\\n- Hot flushes can be accompanied by sweating, and palpitations or sometimes shivering, and can cause embarrassment, anxiety, discomfort and sleep disruption.\\nPossible management options\\n- You should choose clothing fabrics carefully. Opt for a natural, breathable material, such as cotton, linen or bamboo, and avoid wearing synthetic fabrics that can trap heat.\\n- Consider Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), particularly paced breathing and cognitive thinking strategies that can help you focus on your breathing, and reduce the impact of hot flushes. You can find local practitioners online or through your GP\\n- Some antidepressants at a low dose such as Venlafaxine have been found to reduce hot flushes. You can discuss with a specialist or your GP\\n- HRT may be offered by a specialist in the short term (up to 5 years) after a discussion with you about the longer-term benefits and risks.\\nHeading: Sleep disturbance\\n50% of people have sleep issues/insomnia, and this can worsen during menopause\\nPossible management options\\n- Meditation techniques such asyoga nidracan release stress and tension, promoting sleep.\\n- Try downloading meditation and sleep apps such as “Headspace”, “Smiling Mind”, “Calm”, or finding videos onyoutubeto guide you.\\n- Practice good sleep hygiene (Good Sleep Hygiene)\\n- You can also speak to your doctor about interventions such as talking therapy to help with deal with your worries, or short-term medication that can promote sleep.\\nHeading: Vaginal dryness and loss of interest/enjoyment in sex\\n- Locally-applied vaginal oestrogen preparation or non-hormonal options like PJUR gels can be helpful\\n- Loss of interest/enjoyment in sex should be discussed with a doctor or specialist.\\n- Your surgeon or GP can link you in with a specialist.\\n- Counselling may also be useful.

These may also return at different times in your life. Your result may also bring back grief and concern about other family members. It is normal to feel anxious, upset, or even angry that you have this gene fault and it can take time to accept that this is part of who you are. Some people adapt quicker than others; this is also normal. Finding the right support at the right time can make a difference.\\nHeading: Creating a Support Toolkit\\nMental health experts suggest that everyone should create a personal ‘Support Toolkit’ to help with life challenges. A toolkit contains different strategies that you know work for you, when you have experienced a challenging time in the past. Stress or sadness can often prevent you identifying or remembering things that you enjoy or bring meaning to your life. In your toolkit, actively collect tools from various sources that you can easily take out and use to cope with what is causing stress. Some suggestions include:\\n- Identifying healthy lifestyle factors that you know you enjoy like specific exercises, walks or hobbies, specific foods you like, and opportunities to laugh.\\n- Identify people and relationships (family or friends) who will support you in a way that you find helpful\\n- It might also be helpful to think about how you coped with a challenging situation in the past. You may be able to apply some of the same techniques or strategies to your current problem.\\n- Some stress can be caused by uncertainty, so contact your GP or a FCC for information on how to manage uncertainty.If these approaches do not help you, speak to your GP about obtaining professional support. For more long-term support, psychological support with a psychologist or psychiatrist may be helpful.You deserve a good quality of life.\\nHeading: Common emotions and feelings\\nEveryone’s experience is different but listed below are some common emotions women like you have reported feeling at different points in their lives:1,2\\nHeading: Anxiety\\nFinding out that you have a BRCA gene fault can lead to you having an increased level of worry about your cancer risks. This distress may be a result of one or a combination of:\\n- Feelings of uncertainty\\n- Screening anxiety\\n- Concerns for own health\\n- Experience of illness with other family members\\n- Decisions about care and family pressures\\n- Decision making surrounding risk-reducing surgery\\n- Anger or guilt about other family members\\n- Loss of control\\n- Feeling alone or isolatedAny or all of these stressors are completely normal and may appear at different time points. If you are struggling to cope, think about contacting your doctor, specialist or Familial Cancer Centre to receive some further support.\\nHeading: Guilt\\n- You might be feeling guilty about potentially passing this gene on to your biologically-related children.\\n- Remember you cannot control the genes you inherit from your biologically-related parents or the ones you pass on to your biologically-related children.\\n- You may also see it as important information available for other family members to protect them from developing a cancer or identify a cancer in its early stages.\\n- People can also feel “survivor guilt” – guilt that they did not inherit the gene fault and were spared the fate of other relatives.\\n- Contact your Familial Cancer Centre to discuss how you are feeling and the impact the result can have on you and your family.\\nHeading: Grief\\nLoss is a profound feeling and it can be very difficult to deal with it. Feelings of sadness or grief are a common reaction to experiencing a loss, such as:\\n- Losing family members to cancer or\\n- Losing the feeling of normal lifeGrief is a normal reaction to such a loss, however, if these feelings are prolonged or impacting on your daily functions, please seek professional help from GP or other doctor.

It doesn’t necessarily mean you have anxiety or depression if you experience some of these symptoms occasionally. If these symptoms are ongoing or starting to affect other areas of life, like relationships or work, you should speak to someone such as a trusted friend or family member, a GP, therapist, or psychologist about potential treatment.\\nHeading: Support\\nHeading: Peer support\\nYou may find it helpful to read stories from or talk to other people with a gene fault.1You can find a number of online support services both in Australia and internationally that can provide peer support including but not limited to:\\n- Pink Hope:https://www.pinkhope.org.au/- provides programs and support services to empower high risk women and their families\\n- Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE):http://www.facingourrisk.org/- connects cancer survivors, people at high risk and their caregivers to support and resources personalized for their situation\\n- Cancer Council Australia– have trained support volunteers and share personal stories. You can contact them on 13 11 20 orhttps://www.cancer.org.au/support-and-services/support-groups/cancer-connect\\n- Facebook groups\\nHeading: Professional support\\nIt is normal to feel worried, overwhelmed or sad, but when the symptoms are ongoing and start to affect other areas of your life, or you have reasons not to want to talk to your usual supports, you may need more help. Even if you have close friends and a supportive family, you may feel the need for further psychological support. Sometimes you may still feel like you are struggling, even when you use up your entire toolkit. This is the time to seek further professional advice. Talking about these issues with healthcare professionals sooner rather than later, will help you adjust or recover your health1. See your doctor, high-risk specialist, or familial cancer centre for a referral to a self-led counselling tool, psychologist, mental health counsellor, or psychiatrist. Someone who specialises in mental health can discuss different options and/or ongoing support for you. TheMental health care and Medicare webpageis provided by the Australian Government. This will tell you what your options are, what you are entitled to and what costs or claims you may need to make.It is important to remember there is always help available – either online, by phone, or face-to-face.\\nIf you are in crisis and need support, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

Give yourself time to adjust to changes, look after your body, and take your recovery at your own pace.You may find yourself in need of additional support following the risk-reducing removal of your breast tissue. Particularly as sometimes it can be challenging to find information on your own about what it is like after   risk reducing bilateral mastectomy(RRBM). Here are some issues people like you have sought support for at different time points1:\\n\\nHeading: Look and feel of your breasts\\nRRBM is very different to a breast augmentation because the surgeon removes all of your breast tissue. Initially after the surgery, you will experience bruising, swelling and vivid scars and may be shocked at the appearance of your breasts. The look of your breasts will improve over time as:\\n- the bruising and swelling improve\\n- your breasts ‘settle’ into their new positionSkin quality and wound healing will affect how well the scars fade. Try moisturisers, oil and massage.\\nBody image and gender identity\\n- You may find differences in how you feel about your body.\\n- If you choose to have a reconstruction,  y ou may feel as if your reconstructed breasts are not your own and may experience sadness at the loss of your natural breasts.\\nSensationFollowing bilateral mastectomy, you may find you have little sensation left in your breasts.\\nHeading: Relationships\\nHeading: Communicating with family about your surgery\\nLike communicating your genetic test results to family members,you may be worried to tell family and friends about your decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. Support from family and friends forms an important part of healing emotionally. Share the burden both before and after deciding to go ahead with the surgery by talking to others and sharing your feelings with trusted people, as much as you usually feel comfortable to do so.\\nHeading: Communicating with others (colleagues, friends, etc) about your surgery\\nWith time off and possible changed appearance, you may find that friends or work colleagues ask questions that you may or may not be comfortable answering. Consider setting a boundary for each sphere of people (work, friends, close friends/family) with what has happened to manage those situations, to avoid feeling as if you have over-revealed or said something too personal.\\nHeading: Intimate relationships\\nYou may be feeling anxious deciding if and when to tell intimate partners about your surgery and gene fault. People like you have found that sharing this information generally has a positive effect on the relationship and facilitates a greater degree of intimacy.2\\nHeading: Setting realistic expectations\\nDealing with the process, recovery and outcomes of risk-reducing surgery requires a good understanding and psychological preparation.3Your breast surgeon will discuss with you what they recommend as the best options for you. Feel free to ask your breast specialist about possible appearance, pain, discomfort, and recovery time concerns before your surgery. You may also ask for photos with a range of outcomes to prepare you for what your breasts may look and feel like. Your expectations may differ from those of another woman. It is important to continue to communicate with your specialist and others in your care team (familial cancer centre, breast care nurse, etc) as needed. Risk-reducing surgery may not reduce or entirely remove your cancer worry. Talk to your care team if you find you still have concerns about your risk. Often, surgeons will suggest or request a pre-operative psychological assessment to ensure you have considered the psychological, practical and social impact of the risk-reducing surgery.\\nPlanningYou may find it helpful to gather as much information as possible before the surgery.Reducing your breast cancer risk with surgeryand the below listed resources can help you plan physically and emotionally for your surgery. If you don’t know where to start, contact your local Familial Cancer Centre or your doctor who can guide you in the right direction.\\nHeading: Support\\nHeading: Family and friends\\nYou should consider engaging a support system when considering a risk-reducing mastectomy. This includes:\\n- Identifying a person to provide physical support immediately post-surgery is important to help you. You will need help with day-to-day things like preparing meals and going to the bathroom.\\n- You may find that being unable to do things on your own can take an emotional toll. Having someone to talk to and give you words of encouragement can support you mentally during this time.\\n- It may also be helpful to prepare some hobbies or tasks that you can do during your recovery.\\n- Ensure these hobbies are within the recommended physical limitations.\\nHeading: Professional support\\nEven if you have close friends and a supportive family, you may feel the need for further psychological support. If your support needs persist, you may consider accessing help from professionals. To find out more, speak to your breast specialist, breast care nurse, doctor or GP who can also refer you to see a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist, or a sexual health counsellor.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

Give yourself time to adjust to changes, look after your body, and take your recovery at your own pace.\\nYou may find yourself in need of additional support before or following the risk-reducing removal of your ovaries. Evidence shows that those who feel anxious or mood symptoms at the time of the operation do not adjust as well. Remember to seek help sooner rather than later if you find yourself in need of additional support. Here are a number of things people like you have sought support for at different time points:\\nAdjusting to the impact of surgical menopause1,2,3\\n- Physical side effects like hot flushes and change in mood can make you uncomfortable or unhappy\\n- Sleep deprivation or insomnia\\nBody image and gender identityYou may find differences in how you feel about your body.\\nLoss of libido or impaired sexual function which can affect your relationshipIt is unclear how much this results from persistent discomfort during sexual activity due to vaginal dryness, and how much is due to loss of desire, interest and pleasure. Tell your doctor as there may be medication available to improve sexual function but may not improve desire and pleasure with sex.\\nThere is no evidence that this surgery increases your risk of anxiety or depression.\\nHeading: Setting realistic expectations\\nDealing with the process, recovery and outcomes of risk-reducing surgery requires a good understanding and psychological preparation.

Adjusting can also take time and can come with many challenges and changes.Supportive Careprovides general advice and support, whilst this page provides some additional resources for transgender and gender diverse people.\\n- Most importantly, be kind to yourself. Give yourself time. Know that you matter and take care of you.\\n- Use strategies to manage stress or anxiety (SeeSupportive Care)\\n- Know when to ask for help. Everyone struggles at some point in life and everything is easier to manage when we have support from other people.\\n- Consider identifying a key contact in your healthcare team who you trust. This person should be someone you can talk to, can support you and who you can contact with questions you may have\\n- Your healthcare team can also provide referrals for support (i.e. referral to a social worker or psychologist, support group or community organisation)It is important to note that being a gene carrier of BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 should not impact your ability to access gender-affirming surgeries or hormones. With the collaboration of your healthcare team, there are ways to manage an increased cancer risk while still ensuring that you are able to access the necessary support and management needed. The lack of long-term population data and research means many areas of healthcare are still learning about the unique issues and concerns experienced by transgender and gender diverse people. The resources listed below may help provide you with some additional support, but keep in mind that some of these links were developed with people diagnosed with cancer in mind.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

Pictures can also be helpful.\\n- Reassure the young person that they are safe and there are no tests that they have to do.\\nHeading: Considerations\\nHeading: Insurance\\nSome people may have been put off from having a genetic test because of concerns the results of the test may exclude them from obtaining insurance cover. A moratorium put in place in Australia in June 2019 ensures people can access a level of life insurance without being asked about their genetic testing result. This is currently planned to be re-evaluated in mid-2024. See thisfact sheet from the Financial Services Councilfor further information.\\nHeading: Seek advice and support\\nConsider seeking more advice and support from a specialist, such as a genetic counsellor, or your GP before you approach or sit down with your family.

As your gene fault can also be passed onto any biological children, this can also be relevant in your reproductive planning.Exploring topics such as timing of pregnancies, ways in which you can preserve your fertility and options for reproductive genetic testing can support your planning and help to reduce concerns. Fertility specialists and reproductive genetic counsellors can provide information and recommendations to support your reproductive choices.\\nHeading: Contraception methods and effectiveness\\nThere is no singular recommended method of contraception for people with a gene fault. Contraception is a personal choice and it is essential you use birth control safely. You should talk with your doctor to access the most suitable and effective method of contraception for you and your lifestyle.\\nHormonal contraception methods\\n- These include contraceptives such as the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), implants, hormonal intrauterine devices (IUD), or vaginal ring.\\n- There is evidence that suggests taking hormonal contraceptives appears to slightly increase your risk of breast cancer1,2\\n- This is for all women and people with breast tissue, not just those with a gene fault\\n- Throughout your life, this risk is low. Taking hormonal contraceptives should not significantly affect your chances of developing breast cancer\\n- Use a low dose OCP, and avoid progesterone only intrauterine devices3\\n- Some evidence suggests that taking OCP lowers your risk of developing ovarian cancer by 30-40%4.\\nNon-hormonal contraception methods\\n- These include barriers (diaphragm, condoms, etc) or copper IUD and are not associated with an increased cancer risk.\\n- Some metal IUDs may impact MRI screening so check with your breast specialist if you are thinking of getting an IUD.\\nHeading: Planning a pregnancy\\nTiming of pregnancy\\n- Fertility declines naturally with age. It is generally recommended that if you are planning to carry a pregnancy and are in a position to do this, then proceed with your plans as early as is feasible.\\n- Where possible, plan pregnancies to allow breast screening before you become pregnant.\\n- Risk-reducing mastectomywill stop you being able to breastfeed. Consider the timing of your pregnancies if you are intending to have this surgery.\\nOptimising fertility\\n- If you have been trying to become pregnant for 6 months with no success, or have other infertility risks (i.e. age, irregular menstrual cycles or other known predisposing factors) then a consultation with an IVF doctor may be appropriate.\\n- SeeFertilityfor further information.\\nHeading: Considerations for biologically related children\\nEach biologically related child you have now or in the future has a 50% chance of inheriting your gene fault. As there are no associated childhood or adolescent risks associated with BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2, they can seek testing in adulthood should they wish to clarify this further.\\nReproductive genetic testing\\n- You can also test your baby during pregnancy to tell whether the baby has the gene fault or not to inform pregnancy decisions. You should talk to a prenatal genetic counsellor if you are considering this option.\\n- Pre-implantation Genetic Testing (PGT) - is an IVF technique used to test embryos for specific gene faults (including BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2) prior to implantation and pregnancy. You should talk to a reproductive genetic counsellor at an IVF service if you are considering this option.SeeReproductive genetic testingfor further information.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

However, breast screening is more difficult during pregnancy.\\n- Hormone changes during pregnancy cause the breasts to change and you may find your breasts become larger, lumpier, or tender.\\n- Any abnormal lump or concern during pregnancy needs to be reviewed by a doctor.\\n- There are limitations to breast screening when you are either pregnant or breastfeeding.\\n- You cannot have a breast MRI if you are pregnant or breast feeding and this needs to be considered when deciding how long to breast feed for.\\n- An ultrasound or clinical examination may be more appropriate.[caption id=\"attachment_223\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]Cancer on Ultrasound[/caption]\\nHeading: Considerations\\n- Talk to your breast specialist before starting to conceive to make a surveillance plan.\\n- If you are pregnant, talk to your breast specialist to work out what breast screening is most appropriate for you.\\n\\nTopic: Fertility\\n\\nGene: All\\n\\nMin Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nHeading: Recommendations\\n- If you do not have clear plans to consider a pregnancy, or you want to ensure that you will have the option in the future, you may wish to explore fertility preservation options.\\n- There are implications to consider, and you should consult with a fertility doctor if you are interested in hearing more.\\nHeading: Fertility Preservation\\nFertility preservation is used to increase the chance of somebody having children in future. It can be used for medical reasons and personal circumstances\\n- If you are single or wanting to keep future options open and are considering having children in the future, you may wish to consider egg freezing.\\n- This involves cryogenically freezing eggs taken from your ovaries. The cryopreserved eggs can be thawed and utilised through IVF techniques at a later stage if needed.\\n- If you do have a partner, and are considering having children together in the future, you may wish to consider embryo freezing.\\n- This involves eggs first being fertilized with sperm using IVF techniques. After a few days’ development, they become embryos which are then frozen and can be individually thawed and implanted at a later stage if needed.\\nHeading: Infertility\\nFertility specialists can advise you on options to improve your chance of a pregnancy if needed. These include:\\nHeading: Fertility health check\\nThis can be undertaken to help understand the cause of infertility and includes ovulation testing and tracking, pelvic ultrasounds, blood tests, and semen analysis.\\nHeading: Ovulation induction\\nThis can be used if your doctor feels that you are not ovulating regularly or at all. The medications increase the production of eggs in the ovaries to improve the chance of conception.\\nHeading: Assisted reproductive techniques (ART)\\n There are a number of techniques which can be used including: \\n-  Assisted insemination (AI) -This involves insertion of semen through the cervix and into the uterus at or just before the time of ovulation. AI can be performed during a natural menstrual cycle, or in combination with ovulation induction. \\n-  In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) – IVF involves taking eggs and sperm and combining them in a culture dish. If fertilisation occurs and an embryo develops, the embryo is then placed into the uterus in\\u202fa procedure called an\\u202fembryo transfer. Sometimes multiple embryos may develop, and they can be frozen for use in later transfer procedures. The chance of getting pregnant at the end of an IVF cycle is around 30-45% per embryo transferred, depending on age and fertility considerations.  Medicare and private health insurance will cover a large amount of the cost of ART, however there are still out-of-pocket costs. These costs will vary depending on the IVF provider you choose. \\nIf you are concerned about your fertility, there are reproductive options available to help you.These can be used to assist you to conceive a child as your fertility (the ability to get pregnant) decreases. Your peak reproductive years are between the late teens and late 20s. By age 30 years, fertility starts to decline. This decline becomes more rapid from age 37 years, and it is very difficult to become pregnant naturally after the age of 45 years.\\n\\nTopic: Reproductive Genetic Testing\\n\\nGene: All\\n\\nMin Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nThere are a number of reproductive genetic testing options available that can allow you to have biological children who do not inherit your gene fault. This can be achieved through genetic testing in pregnancy or in embryos prior to pregnancy.\\xa0 Genetic counselling is important to ensure you are fully informed about your reproductive options for your individual situation and the associated benefits, risks, and limitations. \\nHeading: Prenatal Diagnostic (PND)\\nPrenatal diagnosis is a diagnostic genetic test in pregnancy to determine if the developing foetus has inherited a gene fault present in either the biological mother or father.\\n- To perform a diagnostic test, a sample of the placenta or amniotic fluid is required as this contains DNA from the developing foetus.\\n- There are two different procedures – chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis - available at different time points in pregnancy. Both involve inserting a long thin needle through the abdomen to obtain the sample. There is a small risk of miscarriage associated with each procedure.\\n- Your obstetrician or doctor will be able to advise which procedure is the most appropriate for you. Prenatal genetic counsellors can also be accessed before any procedure is performed and to discuss the genetic test results with you.\\n- Depending on the gene fault being tested for, the results may take up to two weeks to be available. There can be out of pocket expenses for this type of genetic testing.\\nHeading: Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) \\nPreimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) is a reproductive genetic testing option for individuals at risk of passing on a specific gene fault (such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2) to their biological child.\\n- PGT involves genetic testing on embryos created using IVF techniques to determine which embryos have not inherited the gene fault\\n- The first step towards PGT is called feasibility, which involves designing a genetic test specific for your gene fault to perform on the embryos using DNA from you, your partner and sometimes other family members.\\n- Once a test is feasible, IVF techniques are used to create embryos. When the embryo reaches Day 5-6 in development, a few cells are removed (embryo biopsy) to perform the genetic test\\n- Embryos can also be screened to identify whether the correct number of chromosomes are present. Errors in the early development of sperm, egg or embryo can lead to an abnormal number of chromosomes in a developing embryo and the chance of this occurring increase as you get older. Chromosomally abnormal embryos will fail to implant, miscarry, or result in the birth of a child with a chromosome abnormality.\\n- Only embryos that have not inherited the gene fault and have the correct number of chromosomes are suitable to be used to achieve a pregnancy.\\n- PGT is NOT 100% accurate. Confirmatory prenatal diagnosis is highly recommended if a pregnancy is achieved following PGT.\\n- Medicare rebates are available for feasibility and for genetic testing of embryos although there can often still be some out-of-pocket expenses.An IVF specialist and reproductive genetic counsellor will be able to discuss this with you further.\\nHeading: Additional reproductive options\\n Through assisted reproduction techniques such as IVF, donated eggs, sperm, or embryos can also be accessed that can enable you to have children who have not inherited your gene fault.\\xa0 This may be an option to consider if other underlying fertility issues mean you are unable to use your own egg or sperm to achieve a pregnancy. Another option that can enable someone to have children who have not inherited their gene fault, and if they do not want to consider options related to ART is to instead consider adoption.\\n\\n\\nTopic: Grief Support\\n \\nGene: All\\n\\nMin Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nThis module provides further information on grief and loss with some helpful resources. It will talk about two different types of grief: the grief of testing positive to a gene fault and bereavement where you may have had a loved one die from cancer.1\\nIf you are in crisis and need support, call Lifeline on 13 11 14 or GriefLine on 1300 845 745.\\nHeading: What is grief?\\nGrief is a normal response to any loss. It involves adjusting to life without the person who has died. There are other types of grief, including anticipatory grief, which involves grieving for a future loss.2Further information can be found atAustralian Centre for Grief and Bereavement(ACGB). There is no right or wrong way to grieve, no set time period and the grief may never go away completely. Sometimes the pain of loss can feel overwhelming, but, with support and understanding, you will find a way forward.\\nHeading: Grief and cancer predisposing gene faults\\nBecause of the inherited nature of gene faults, it is likely that you have had a family member who has died following a cancer diagnosis. Here are some resources surrounding grief and cancer that may be helpful for you:\\n- Cancer Council -https://www.cancervic.org.au/living-with-cancer/grief/grief-overview.html\\n- Cancer.Net -https://www.cancer.net/coping-with-cancer/managing-emotions/grief-and-lossReceiving a genetic test result, going for screening or undergoing a risk reducing procedure can trigger grief that you may have thought you had previously dealt with.1Reach out to a family member or friend, your breast specialist, doctor, or Familial Cancer Centre if you want to talk through this further.\\nHeading: Support\\nYou may be feeling alone and finding it difficult to make sense of the grief in your life. Everyone reacts differently and what you are feeling is normal.Do not judge yourself harshly as grief is not a weakness but a sign of how important that person was to you. It is important that you get the support and help you need. It may also be helpful to:\\n- Talk with people or reading the stories of people who have had similar experiences and can understand your feelings.\\n- Talk with someone else in your family who has the BRCA gene fault as they may be experiencing something similar to you.\\n- SeeSupportive Carefor more suggestions\\nHeading: Supporting someone else\\n- When someone you care about is grieving after a loss, it can be difficult to know what to say or do.\\n- Don’t let fears about saying or doing the wrong thing stop you from reaching out.\\n- Let the person know you are there to listen.\\n- Ask the person what help would be useful to them or offer to help in practical ways.\\n- Understand that everyone grieves differently and for different lengths of time.\\n- For more information:https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/servicesandsupport/grief-how-to-support-the-bereavedhttps://www.helpguide.org/articles/grief/helping-someone-who-is-grieving.htm\\nHeading: Professional support\\n- Even if you have close friends and a supportive family, you may feel the need for further psychological support.\\n- See your doctor, high-risk specialist, or familial cancer centre for a discussion and potential referral to a psychologist, mental health counsellor, or psychiatrist. Someone who specialises in mental health can discuss different options and/or ongoing support for you.\\n- There are also a number of professional counselling and support telephone, SMS and video service resources includingGriefLine\\n- TheMental health care and Medicare webpageis provided by the Australian Government.

However, RRBM is only known to reduce instances of breast cancer related death by around 3%.2,3\\n- It is important to know that breast reduction surgery does not reduce breast cancer risk as much as bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM).\\n- If you have had breast reduction or gender-affirming surgery, you should discuss your cancer risks and management with your specialist.\\n- SeeImpact of risk reducing mastectomyfor further considerations and recommendations before deciding about RRBM.\\nHeading: What you should know about Bilateral Mastectomy\\nRisk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy (RRBM) is recommended by age 40 years to optimise your reduction in breast cancer risk1RRBM involves surgery to remove the breast tissue and includes:\\n- Total mastectomy – this procedure allows removal of the most breast tissue by removing the skin surrounding the breast and the nipple and areola.\\n- Skin sparing mastectomy – this involves removing as much breast tissue as possible and the nipple and areola, while keeping the skin envelope over the breast. This allows the shape of your breast to be maintained if you choose to have a breast reconstruction.\\n- Nipple sparing mastectomy – this allows the skin around the breast and the nipple and areola to remain. It does not allow for removal of as much breast tissue as a total mastectomy, as some tissue is left behind the nipple.It is important to know that breast reduction surgery does not reduce breast cancer risk as much as bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM).\\n- If you have had breast reduction or gender-affirming surgery, you should discuss your cancer risks and management with your specialist.Depending on the type of surgery, you will likely be in hospital for 3 to 5 days; however allow up to 6 weeks before resuming your normal activities.\\n- RRBM is either performed at a public or private hospital.\\n- There are no costs when undergoing RRBM at a public hospital, however, there is a wait list.\\n- There may be shorter wait times at a private hospital, however there are costs involved.\\nThe decision for RRBM is a personal one and should be made in consultation with a specialist who can explain the risks and benefits to you.\\nHeading: RRBM Support\\n- It normal for people who have undergone RRBM to reduce their cancer risk to report challenges in decision making and after the surgery itself.\\n- SeeImpact of risk reducing mastectomyfor further information.\\nHeading: After RRBM\\nAs with all surgeries, there are potential associated complications, your surgeon will explain this to you in detail. It is not uncommon to require follow up after your surgery. The following is a list of potential complications associated with RRBM;\\n- Short-term\\n- Pain, tingling or numbness following surgery\\n- Infection and bleeding\\n- Longer-term\\n- Pain and discomfort in reconstructed breast\\n- Loss of sensitivity in nipple and areola\\n- Need for repeat surgeries\\n- Dissatisfaction with the change in appearance of your breasts\\nHeading: Reconstruction\\n- Some people to choose to weari a breast prosthesis fitted into a bra, or have a breast reconstruction (usually performed by a plastic surgeon).\\n- If you choose to have a breast reconstruction, this can be performed immediately at the time of your surgery, or it can be delayed. Reconstruction can be done using an implant or with your natural body tissue.\\nHeading: Wound care\\n- Immediately after surgery you will need to keep your wound taped for 1 to 2 weeks\\n- For the next two months you should massage the scars every day using any type of moisturising product.\\n- The scar will be pink and noticeable initially but massage will allow you to obtain the best possible result.\\nHeading: Activity\\n- For the first 6 weeks, you can use your arms for eating, dressing and showering, but only as much as is comfortable for you.\\n- When you start household activities again, begin with lighter duties first. Remember to pace yourself and take regular breaks. It is important to slowly build up your level of activity.\\n- Most people are advised not to drive for 4 weeks after their surgery, but this depends on the type of procedure.\\nHeading: Exercise\\n- Arm exercise post-surgery will help improve movement and ease the stiffness in your arms. It may also help with a faster recovery.\\n- The exercises will vary depending on whether you have had reconstruction or not at the same time as your RRBM.\\n- Ask your surgeon what exercises you can do and when to begin.\\nHeading: Risk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy\\nRisk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy (RRBM) is the most effective way to reduce your breast cancer risk but requires careful discussion with a specialist about advantages and disadvantages.1\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

Your personal risk of breast cancer is modified by genetic and non-genetic risk factors1,2. The higher your genetic risk, the more opportunity you have to reduce your risk compared with other people in the population1.\\nYou have the ability to take an active role in controlling some of these lifestyle factors to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer.\\nHeading: What lifestyle changes can reduce your cancer risk?\\nYou can talk to your GP about how to personalise the recommendations below to your lifestyle.\\nHeading: Alcohol intake: No more than 10 standard drinks a week\\n- Drinking alcohol increases your risk of breast and other cancers. The more you drink, the more your risk of developing breast cancer increases1.\\n- Drinking 3-6 glasses of wine per week increases your risk by 15%\\n- Drinking 14 glasses of wine per week increases your risk by 50%\\n- It is recommended you have no more than 10 standard drinks per week, and no more than 4 standard drinks on any one day3.\\n- For practical advice to help reduce your alcohol intake, visit:https://www.cancer.org.au/blog/12-tips-to-reduce-your-alcohol-intake\\nHeading: Weight gain and BMI: Attain and Maintain a healthy weight for your height\\n- Being overweight increases your risk of developing many cancers4.\\n- Increased weight gain especially after menopause increases your breast cancer risk5.\\n- Body fat can be measured as Body Mass Index (BMI) which allows for your height. For each 5-unit increase in BMI after menopause, your risk of breast cancer increases by about 12%1,2.\\n- Maintaining a BMI within the healthy range for adults (18.4-24.9) reduces your cancer risk and protects your future bone and heart health6.\\n- You can determine your BMI and your healthy weight range by visiting:https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/tools/body-mass-index-calculator-for-adult\\n- You can read the Australian Government Healthy Weight Guide for information and practical resources to help you maintain a healthy weight by visitinghttps://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/healthyliving/weight-management\\nHeading: Exercise: Regularly\\n- Physical activity is known to lower the risk of breast cancer by up to 20%, independent of BMI1.\\n- It is recommended you do 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise most days, or every day if you can7.

These may also return at different times in your life. Your result may also bring back grief and concern about other family members. It is normal to feel anxious, upset, or even angry that you have this gene fault and it can take time to accept that this is part of who you are. Some people adapt quicker than others; this is also normal. Finding the right support at the right time can make a difference.\\nHeading: Creating a Support Toolkit\\nMental health experts suggest that everyone should create a personal ‘Support Toolkit’ to help with life challenges. A toolkit contains different strategies that you know work for you, when you have experienced a challenging time in the past. Stress or sadness can often prevent you identifying or remembering things that you enjoy or bring meaning to your life. In your toolkit, actively collect tools from various sources that you can easily take out and use to cope with what is causing stress. Some suggestions include:\\n- Identifying healthy lifestyle factors that you know you enjoy like specific exercises, walks or hobbies, specific foods you like, and opportunities to laugh.\\n- Identify people and relationships (family or friends) who will support you in a way that you find helpful\\n- It might also be helpful to think about how you coped with a challenging situation in the past. You may be able to apply some of the same techniques or strategies to your current problem.\\n- Some stress can be caused by uncertainty, so contact your GP or a FCC for information on how to manage uncertainty.If these approaches do not help you, speak to your GP about obtaining professional support. For more long-term support, psychological support with a psychologist or psychiatrist may be helpful.You deserve a good quality of life.\\nHeading: Common emotions and feelings\\nEveryone’s experience is different but listed below are some common emotions women like you have reported feeling at different points in their lives:1,2\\nHeading: Anxiety\\nFinding out that you have a BRCA gene fault can lead to you having an increased level of worry about your cancer risks. This distress may be a result of one or a combination of:\\n- Feelings of uncertainty\\n- Screening anxiety\\n- Concerns for own health\\n- Experience of illness with other family members\\n- Decisions about care and family pressures\\n- Decision making surrounding risk-reducing surgery\\n- Anger or guilt about other family members\\n- Loss of control\\n- Feeling alone or isolatedAny or all of these stressors are completely normal and may appear at different time points. If you are struggling to cope, think about contacting your doctor, specialist or Familial Cancer Centre to receive some further support.\\nHeading: Guilt\\n- You might be feeling guilty about potentially passing this gene on to your biologically-related children.\\n- Remember you cannot control the genes you inherit from your biologically-related parents or the ones you pass on to your biologically-related children.\\n- You may also see it as important information available for other family members to protect them from developing a cancer or identify a cancer in its early stages.\\n- People can also feel “survivor guilt” – guilt that they did not inherit the gene fault and were spared the fate of other relatives.\\n- Contact your Familial Cancer Centre to discuss how you are feeling and the impact the result can have on you and your family.\\nHeading: Grief\\nLoss is a profound feeling and it can be very difficult to deal with it. Feelings of sadness or grief are a common reaction to experiencing a loss, such as:\\n- Losing family members to cancer or\\n- Losing the feeling of normal lifeGrief is a normal reaction to such a loss, however, if these feelings are prolonged or impacting on your daily functions, please seek professional help from GP or other doctor.

Give yourself time to adjust to changes, look after your body, and take your recovery at your own pace.You may find yourself in need of additional support following the risk-reducing removal of your breast tissue. Particularly as sometimes it can be challenging to find information on your own about what it is like after   risk reducing bilateral mastectomy(RRBM). Here are some issues people like you have sought support for at different time points1:\\n\\nHeading: Look and feel of your breasts\\nRRBM is very different to a breast augmentation because the surgeon removes all of your breast tissue. Initially after the surgery, you will experience bruising, swelling and vivid scars and may be shocked at the appearance of your breasts. The look of your breasts will improve over time as:\\n- the bruising and swelling improve\\n- your breasts ‘settle’ into their new positionSkin quality and wound healing will affect how well the scars fade. Try moisturisers, oil and massage.\\nBody image and gender identity\\n- You may find differences in how you feel about your body.\\n- If you choose to have a reconstruction,  y ou may feel as if your reconstructed breasts are not your own and may experience sadness at the loss of your natural breasts.\\nSensationFollowing bilateral mastectomy, you may find you have little sensation left in your breasts.\\nHeading: Relationships\\nHeading: Communicating with family about your surgery\\nLike communicating your genetic test results to family members,you may be worried to tell family and friends about your decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. Support from family and friends forms an important part of healing emotionally. Share the burden both before and after deciding to go ahead with the surgery by talking to others and sharing your feelings with trusted people, as much as you usually feel comfortable to do so.\\nHeading: Communicating with others (colleagues, friends, etc) about your surgery\\nWith time off and possible changed appearance, you may find that friends or work colleagues ask questions that you may or may not be comfortable answering. Consider setting a boundary for each sphere of people (work, friends, close friends/family) with what has happened to manage those situations, to avoid feeling as if you have over-revealed or said something too personal.\\nHeading: Intimate relationships\\nYou may be feeling anxious deciding if and when to tell intimate partners about your surgery and gene fault. People like you have found that sharing this information generally has a positive effect on the relationship and facilitates a greater degree of intimacy.2\\nHeading: Setting realistic expectations\\nDealing with the process, recovery and outcomes of risk-reducing surgery requires a good understanding and psychological preparation.3Your breast surgeon will discuss with you what they recommend as the best options for you. Feel free to ask your breast specialist about possible appearance, pain, discomfort, and recovery time concerns before your surgery. You may also ask for photos with a range of outcomes to prepare you for what your breasts may look and feel like. Your expectations may differ from those of another woman. It is important to continue to communicate with your specialist and others in your care team (familial cancer centre, breast care nurse, etc) as needed. Risk-reducing surgery may not reduce or entirely remove your cancer worry. Talk to your care team if you find you still have concerns about your risk. Often, surgeons will suggest or request a pre-operative psychological assessment to ensure you have considered the psychological, practical and social impact of the risk-reducing surgery.\\nPlanningYou may find it helpful to gather as much information as possible before the surgery.Reducing your breast cancer risk with surgeryand the below listed resources can help you plan physically and emotionally for your surgery. If you don’t know where to start, contact your local Familial Cancer Centre or your doctor who can guide you in the right direction.\\nHeading: Support\\nHeading: Family and friends\\nYou should consider engaging a support system when considering a risk-reducing mastectomy. This includes:\\n- Identifying a person to provide physical support immediately post-surgery is important to help you. You will need help with day-to-day things like preparing meals and going to the bathroom.\\n- You may find that being unable to do things on your own can take an emotional toll. Having someone to talk to and give you words of encouragement can support you mentally during this time.\\n- It may also be helpful to prepare some hobbies or tasks that you can do during your recovery.\\n- Ensure these hobbies are within the recommended physical limitations.\\nHeading: Professional support\\nEven if you have close friends and a supportive family, you may feel the need for further psychological support. If your support needs persist, you may consider accessing help from professionals. To find out more, speak to your breast specialist, breast care nurse, doctor or GP who can also refer you to see a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist, or a sexual health counsellor.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

Give yourself time. Know that you matter and take care of you.\\n- Use strategies to manage stress or anxiety (SeeSupportive Care)\\n- Know when to ask for help. Everyone struggles at some point in life and everything is easier to manage when we have support from other people.\\n- Consider identifying a key contact in your healthcare team who you trust. This person should be someone you can talk to, can support you and who you can contact with questions you may have\\n- Your healthcare team can also provide referrals for support (i.e. referral to a social worker or psychologist, support group or community organisation)It is important to note that being a gene carrier of BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 should not impact your ability to access gender-affirming surgeries or hormones. With the collaboration of your healthcare team, there are ways to manage an increased cancer risk while still ensuring that you are able to access the necessary support and management needed. The lack of long-term population data and research means many areas of healthcare are still learning about the unique issues and concerns experienced by transgender and gender diverse people.

Taking hormonal contraceptives should not significantly affect your chances of developing breast cancer\\n- Use a low dose OCP, and avoid progesterone only intrauterine devices3\\n- Some evidence suggests that taking OCP lowers your risk of developing ovarian cancer by 30-40%4.\\nNon-hormonal contraception methods\\n- These include barriers (diaphragm, condoms, etc) or copper IUD and are not associated with an increased cancer risk.\\n- Some metal IUDs may impact MRI screening so check with your breast specialist if you are thinking of getting an IUD.\\nHeading: Planning a pregnancy\\nTiming of pregnancy\\n- Fertility declines naturally with age. It is generally recommended that if you are planning to carry a pregnancy and are in a position to do this, then proceed with your plans as early as is feasible.\\n- Where possible, plan pregnancies to allow breast screening before you become pregnant.\\n- Risk-reducing mastectomywill stop you being able to breastfeed. Consider the timing of your pregnancies if you are intending to have this surgery.\\nOptimising fertility\\n- If you have been trying to become pregnant for 6 months with no success, or have other infertility risks (i.e. age, irregular menstrual cycles or other known predisposing factors) then a consultation with an IVF doctor may be appropriate.\\n- SeeFertilityfor further information.\\nHeading: Considerations for biologically related children\\nEach biologically related child you have now or in the future has a 50% chance of inheriting your gene fault. As there are no associated childhood or adolescent risks associated with BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2, they can seek testing in adulthood should they wish to clarify this further.\\nReproductive genetic testing\\n- You can also test your baby during pregnancy to tell whether the baby has the gene fault or not to inform pregnancy decisions. You should talk to a prenatal genetic counsellor if you are considering this option.\\n- Pre-implantation Genetic Testing (PGT) - is an IVF technique used to test embryos for specific gene faults (including BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2) prior to implantation and pregnancy. You should talk to a reproductive genetic counsellor at an IVF service if you are considering this option.SeeReproductive genetic testingfor further information.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

However, breast screening is more difficult during pregnancy.\\n- Hormone changes during pregnancy cause the breasts to change and you may find your breasts become larger, lumpier, or tender.\\n- Any abnormal lump or concern during pregnancy needs to be reviewed by a doctor.\\n- There are limitations to breast screening when you are either pregnant or breastfeeding.\\n- You cannot have a breast MRI if you are pregnant or breast feeding and this needs to be considered when deciding how long to breast feed for.\\n- An ultrasound or clinical examination may be more appropriate.[caption id=\"attachment_223\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]Cancer on Ultrasound[/caption]\\nHeading: Considerations\\n- Talk to your breast specialist before starting to conceive to make a surveillance plan.\\n- If you are pregnant, talk to your breast specialist to work out what breast screening is most appropriate for you.'}, {'text': 'Min Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nHeading: Recommendations\\n- If you do not have clear plans to consider a pregnancy, or you want to ensure that you will have the option in the future, you may wish to explore fertility preservation options.\\n- There are implications to consider, and you should consult with a fertility doctor if you are interested in hearing more.\\nHeading: Fertility Preservation\\nFertility preservation is used to increase the chance of somebody having children in future. It can be used for medical reasons and personal circumstances\\n- If you are single or wanting to keep future options open and are considering having children in the future, you may wish to consider egg freezing.\\n- This involves cryogenically freezing eggs taken from your ovaries. The cryopreserved eggs can be thawed and utilised through IVF techniques at a later stage if needed.\\n- If you do have a partner, and are considering having children together in the future, you may wish to consider embryo freezing.\\n- This involves eggs first being fertilized with sperm using IVF techniques. After a few days’ development, they become embryos which are then frozen and can be individually thawed and implanted at a later stage if needed.\\nHeading: Infertility\\nFertility specialists can advise you on options to improve your chance of a pregnancy if needed. These include:\\nHeading: Fertility health check\\nThis can be undertaken to help understand the cause of infertility and includes ovulation testing and tracking, pelvic ultrasounds, blood tests, and semen analysis.\\nHeading: Ovulation induction\\nThis can be used if your doctor feels that you are not ovulating regularly or at all. The medications increase the production of eggs in the ovaries to improve the chance of conception.\\nHeading: Assisted reproductive techniques (ART)\\n There are a number of techniques which can be used including: \\n-  Assisted insemination (AI) -This involves insertion of semen through the cervix and into the uterus at or just before the time of ovulation. AI can be performed during a natural menstrual cycle, or in combination with ovulation induction. \\n-  In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) – IVF involves taking eggs and sperm and combining them in a culture dish. If fertilisation occurs and an embryo develops, the embryo is then placed into the uterus in\\u202fa procedure called an\\u202fembryo transfer. Sometimes multiple embryos may develop, and they can be frozen for use in later transfer procedures. The chance of getting pregnant at the end of an IVF cycle is around 30-45% per embryo transferred, depending on age and fertility considerations.  Medicare and private health insurance will cover a large amount of the cost of ART, however there are still out-of-pocket costs. These costs will vary depending on the IVF provider you choose. \\nIf you are concerned about your fertility, there are reproductive options available to help you.These can be used to assist you to conceive a child as your fertility (the ability to get pregnant) decreases. Your peak reproductive years are between the late teens and late 20s. By age 30 years, fertility starts to decline. This decline becomes more rapid from age 37 years, and it is very difficult to become pregnant naturally after the age of 45 years.'}, {'text': 'Min Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nThere are a number of reproductive genetic testing options available that can allow you to have biological children who do not inherit your gene fault. This can be achieved through genetic testing in pregnancy or in embryos prior to pregnancy.\\xa0 Genetic counselling is important to ensure you are fully informed about your reproductive options for your individual situation and the associated benefits, risks, and limitations. \\nHeading: Prenatal Diagnostic (PND)\\nPrenatal diagnosis is a diagnostic genetic test in pregnancy to determine if the developing foetus has inherited a gene fault present in either the biological mother or father.\\n- To perform a diagnostic test, a sample of the placenta or amniotic fluid is required as this contains DNA from the developing foetus.\\n- There are two different procedures – chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis - available at different time points in pregnancy. Both involve inserting a long thin needle through the abdomen to obtain the sample. There is a small risk of miscarriage associated with each procedure.\\n- Your obstetrician or doctor will be able to advise which procedure is the most appropriate for you. Prenatal genetic counsellors can also be accessed before any procedure is performed and to discuss the genetic test results with you.\\n- Depending on the gene fault being tested for, the results may take up to two weeks to be available. There can be out of pocket expenses for this type of genetic testing.\\nHeading: Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) \\nPreimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) is a reproductive genetic testing option for individuals at risk of passing on a specific gene fault (such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2) to their biological child.\\n- PGT involves genetic testing on embryos created using IVF techniques to determine which embryos have not inherited the gene fault\\n- The first step towards PGT is called feasibility, which involves designing a genetic test specific for your gene fault to perform on the embryos using DNA from you, your partner and sometimes other family members.\\n- Once a test is feasible, IVF techniques are used to create embryos. When the embryo reaches Day 5-6 in development, a few cells are removed (embryo biopsy) to perform the genetic test\\n- Embryos can also be screened to identify whether the correct number of chromosomes are present. Errors in the early development of sperm, egg or embryo can lead to an abnormal number of chromosomes in a developing embryo and the chance of this occurring increase as you get older. Chromosomally abnormal embryos will fail to implant, miscarry, or result in the birth of a child with a chromosome abnormality.\\n- Only embryos that have not inherited the gene fault and have the correct number of chromosomes are suitable to be used to achieve a pregnancy.\\n- PGT is NOT 100% accurate. Confirmatory prenatal diagnosis is highly recommended if a pregnancy is achieved following PGT.\\n- Medicare rebates are available for feasibility and for genetic testing of embryos although there can often still be some out-of-pocket expenses.An IVF specialist and reproductive genetic counsellor will be able to discuss this with you further.\\nHeading: Additional reproductive options\\n Through assisted reproduction techniques such as IVF, donated eggs, sperm, or embryos can also be accessed that can enable you to have children who have not inherited your gene fault.\\xa0 This may be an option to consider if other underlying fertility issues mean you are unable to use your own egg or sperm to achieve a pregnancy. Another option that can enable someone to have children who have not inherited their gene fault, and if they do not want to consider options related to ART is to instead consider adoption.'}, {'text': 'Min Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nThis module provides further information on grief and loss with some helpful resources. It will talk about two different types of grief: the grief of testing positive to a gene fault and bereavement where you may have had a loved one die from cancer.1\\nIf you are in crisis and need support, call Lifeline on 13 11 14 or GriefLine on 1300 845 745.\\nHeading: What is grief?\\nGrief is a normal response to any loss. It involves adjusting to life without the person who has died. There are other types of grief, including anticipatory grief, which involves grieving for a future loss.2Further information can be found atAustralian Centre for Grief and Bereavement(ACGB). There is no right or wrong way to grieve, no set time period and the grief may never go away completely. Sometimes the pain of loss can feel overwhelming, but, with support and understanding, you will find a way forward.\\nHeading: Grief and cancer predisposing gene faults\\nBecause of the inherited nature of gene faults, it is likely that you have had a family member who has died following a cancer diagnosis. Here are some resources surrounding grief and cancer that may be helpful for you:\\n- Cancer Council -https://www.cancervic.org.au/living-with-cancer/grief/grief-overview.html\\n- Cancer.Net -https://www.cancer.net/coping-with-cancer/managing-emotions/grief-and-lossReceiving a genetic test result, going for screening or undergoing a risk reducing procedure can trigger grief that you may have thought you had previously dealt with.1Reach out to a family member or friend, your breast specialist, doctor, or Familial Cancer Centre if you want to talk through this further.\\nHeading: Support\\nYou may be feeling alone and finding it difficult to make sense of the grief in your life. Everyone reacts differently and what you are feeling is normal.Do not judge yourself harshly as grief is not a weakness but a sign of how important that person was to you. It is important that you get the support and help you need. It may also be helpful to:\\n- Talk with people or reading the stories of people who have had similar experiences and can understand your feelings.\\n- Talk with someone else in your family who has the BRCA gene fault as they may be experiencing something similar to you.\\n- SeeSupportive Carefor more suggestions\\nHeading: Supporting someone else\\n- When someone you care about is grieving after a loss, it can be difficult to know what to say or do.\\n- Don’t let fears about saying or doing the wrong thing stop you from reaching out.\\n- Let the person know you are there to listen.\\n- Ask the person what help would be useful to them or offer to help in practical ways.\\n- Understand that everyone grieves differently and for different lengths of time.\\n- For more information:https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/servicesandsupport/grief-how-to-support-the-bereavedhttps://www.helpguide.org/articles/grief/helping-someone-who-is-grieving.htm\\nHeading: Professional support\\n- Even if you have close friends and a supportive family, you may feel the need for further psychological support.\\n- See your doctor, high-risk specialist, or familial cancer centre for a discussion and potential referral to a psychologist, mental health counsellor, or psychiatrist. Someone who specialises in mental health can discuss different options and/or ongoing support for you.\\n- There are also a number of professional counselling and support telephone, SMS and video service resources includingGriefLine\\n- TheMental health care and Medicare webpageis provided by the Australian Government.

BRCA1 gene fault is around 2-7%1. In other words, 20-70 out of every 1000 people will develop breast cancer by the age of 30.\\n- Some hospitals offer comprehensive risk management clinics for people with a BRCA1 gene fault, ask at your local cancer genetic services\\n- To see a full list of all Australia cancer genetics services, please visit:https://www.genetics.edu.au/genetic-services/cancer-genetics-clinics\\nIf you have not had risk-reducing breast surgery, annual breast screening is recommended from age 30 years2.Breast screening aims to detect breast cancer at an early stage before symptoms begin and it can be most easily treated.\\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most effective breast screening method in people under 60 years old2.\\n- MRI is funded through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS item number 63464) until the age of 60 years with no “out-of-pocket” costs3.\\n- Mammograms are now recommended from the age of 40 years2. This follows changes to Australian guidelines in 20182.\\nPeople assigned male at birth do not need to undergo breast screening\\n- This is whether you have had gender-affirming surgery or not.\\n- If you identify as transgender or gender diverse, you can find additional resources inTransgender and Gender Diverse PeopleBreast screening is not possible while pregnant or breast feeding2. When planning a pregnancy please discuss screening with your specialist. Surgery to remove your breast tissue is known as Bilateral Risk-Reducing Mastectomy (BRRM). This is the most effective way to reduce your breast cancer risk by more than 90%6,7. For more information, you can readReducing your breast cancer risk with surgery. You may also consider taking certain medications such as Tamoxifen after a discussion with your specialist2.\\nHeading: What you can do to manage your risk at your age\\nThe following risk management recommendations are based on current Australian guidelines.\\nHeading: If a close family member had breast cancer before the age of 35 years\\n- You should discuss personalised breast screening with your specialist. It may be appropriate to begin screening before the age 30 years.\\nHeading: Standard breast screening\\nYou should begin breast screening every year from the age of 30 years.\\n- This will involve annual MRI screening, and possible targeted breast ultrasound to follow up any abnormal findings.\\n- You will need to be referred to a breast surgeon or risk management clinic to access screening. Ask your GP to provide a referral based on your personal circumstances and preferences.\\n- Remember most clinics have waiting lists so plan 6 months in advance.\\n- If you are planning a pregnancy, please discuss with your GP\\n- Any breast cysts can be looked at using Breast ultrasound[caption id=\"attachment_223\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]Cancer on Ultrasound[/caption]\\nHeading: People assigned female at birth should undergo breast screening unless they have had gender-affirming surgery \\n-  If you have had gender-affirming surgery or medication, you should discuss your ca ncer risks and management with your specialist. \\n-  It is i mportant to know that gender-affirming surgery and/or medication do n o t reduce breast cancer risk as much as bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM)\\n-  If you identify as transgender or gender diverse, you can find additional resources inTransgender and Gender Diverse People\\nHeading: What if you have had Bilateral Risk-Reducing Mastectomy (BRRM)\\nIf you have already undertaken Bilateral Risk-Reducing Mastectomy (BRRM) you have reduced your risk of developing breast cancer by at least 90%2,4,5\\n- It is important to know that breast reduction surgery does not reduce breast cancer risk as much as bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM).\\n- If you have had breast reduction or gender-affirming surgery, you should discuss your cancer risks and management with your specialist.\\n- It isnotrecommend that you undergo yearly breast surveillance after a BRRM2.\\n- You should follow any personalised recommendations from your specialist and be aware that you may still be at an increased risk of ovarian cancer (please seeReducing your ovarian cancer risk with surgery).\\n- If you have any concerns, you can discuss these with your specialist.\\n- Dealing with the outcomes of risk-reducing surgery can be difficult. To find support suggestions specific to people who have undergone mastectomy, seeImpact of risk reducing mastectomy.\\nHeading: Things to consider\\n- Your recommended screening schedule will change as you get older2.\\n- Breast MRI requires you to lie in a confined space for up to 60 minutes6,7, depending on the type of MRI used. The procedure is painless and very safe. However some people report this can be uncomfortable, and if you have claustrophobia MRI may be difficult.\\n- You can learn more about MRI and find support suggestions at:https://www.thermh.org.au/patients-visitors/services-clinics/x-rays-scans-imaging/mri\\n- It is common to experience anxiety prior to undergoing screening or considering your screening options. For support suggestions seeSupportive Care - General Advice\\n- If you are pregnant, it recommended that you do not undergo MRI2.

However, RRBM is only known to reduce instances of breast cancer related death by around 3%.2,3\\n- It is important to know that breast reduction surgery does not reduce breast cancer risk as much as bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM).\\n- If you have had breast reduction or gender-affirming surgery, you should discuss your cancer risks and management with your specialist.\\n- SeeImpact of risk reducing mastectomyfor further considerations and recommendations before deciding about RRBM.\\nHeading: What you should know about Bilateral Mastectomy\\nRisk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy (RRBM) is recommended by age 40 years to optimise your reduction in breast cancer risk1RRBM involves surgery to remove the breast tissue and includes:\\n- Total mastectomy – this procedure allows removal of the most breast tissue by removing the skin surrounding the breast and the nipple and areola.\\n- Skin sparing mastectomy – this involves removing as much breast tissue as possible and the nipple and areola, while keeping the skin envelope over the breast. This allows the shape of your breast to be maintained if you choose to have a breast reconstruction.\\n- Nipple sparing mastectomy – this allows the skin around the breast and the nipple and areola to remain. It does not allow for removal of as much breast tissue as a total mastectomy, as some tissue is left behind the nipple.It is important to know that breast reduction surgery does not reduce breast cancer risk as much as bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM).\\n- If you have had breast reduction or gender-affirming surgery, you should discuss your cancer risks and management with your specialist.Depending on the type of surgery, you will likely be in hospital for 3 to 5 days; however allow up to 6 weeks before resuming your normal activities.\\n- RRBM is either performed at a public or private hospital.\\n- There are no costs when undergoing RRBM at a public hospital, however, there is a wait list.\\n- There may be shorter wait times at a private hospital, however there are costs involved.\\nThe decision for RRBM is a personal one and should be made in consultation with a specialist who can explain the risks and benefits to you.\\nHeading: RRBM Support\\n- It normal for people who have undergone RRBM to reduce their cancer risk to report challenges in decision making and after the surgery itself.\\n- SeeImpact of risk reducing mastectomyfor further information.\\nHeading: After RRBM\\nAs with all surgeries, there are potential associated complications, your surgeon will explain this to you in detail. It is not uncommon to require follow up after your surgery. The following is a list of potential complications associated with RRBM;\\n- Short-term\\n- Pain, tingling or numbness following surgery\\n- Infection and bleeding\\n- Longer-term\\n- Pain and discomfort in reconstructed breast\\n- Loss of sensitivity in nipple and areola\\n- Need for repeat surgeries\\n- Dissatisfaction with the change in appearance of your breasts\\nHeading: Reconstruction\\n- Some people to choose to weari a breast prosthesis fitted into a bra, or have a breast reconstruction (usually performed by a plastic surgeon).\\n- If you choose to have a breast reconstruction, this can be performed immediately at the time of your surgery, or it can be delayed. Reconstruction can be done using an implant or with your natural body tissue.\\nHeading: Wound care\\n- Immediately after surgery you will need to keep your wound taped for 1 to 2 weeks\\n- For the next two months you should massage the scars every day using any type of moisturising product.\\n- The scar will be pink and noticeable initially but massage will allow you to obtain the best possible result.\\nHeading: Activity\\n- For the first 6 weeks, you can use your arms for eating, dressing and showering, but only as much as is comfortable for you.\\n- When you start household activities again, begin with lighter duties first. Remember to pace yourself and take regular breaks. It is important to slowly build up your level of activity.\\n- Most people are advised not to drive for 4 weeks after their surgery, but this depends on the type of procedure.\\nHeading: Exercise\\n- Arm exercise post-surgery will help improve movement and ease the stiffness in your arms. It may also help with a faster recovery.\\n- The exercises will vary depending on whether you have had reconstruction or not at the same time as your RRBM.\\n- Ask your surgeon what exercises you can do and when to begin.\\nHeading: Risk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy\\nRisk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy (RRBM) is the most effective way to reduce your breast cancer risk but requires careful discussion with a specialist about advantages and disadvantages.1\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

RRSO will reduce your risk by >90%\\n- RRSO should be considered from age 50 years.\\n- Your ovarian cancer risk is higher if you have a close relative with ovarian cancer\\nHeading: We recommend you consider risk-reducing surgery at this age \\nRisk-reducing surgical removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes (also called risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy or RRSO)\\nHeading: Timing\\nRRSO is recommended from the age of 50 years (and after family completion) to reduce your risk of ovarian cancer.\\nHeading: Surgery\\n- This involves removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes, it usually does not require removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) unless there are other personal medical issues to consider.\\n- The surgery is performed by specialist gynaecological surgeons who will discuss your personal circumstances and possible side effects of the surgery.\\n- The procedure can be performed using laparoscopic or keyhole surgery, and will usually only require an overnight stay in hospital. In a small number of cases a larger operation is needed based on your previous medical history. Your surgeon will discuss any risk factors with you before surgery.\\n- The surgeon will perform a review of the abdomen and pelvis, and send samples for pathology testing at the time of surgery. This is to check for any disease which may already be present, which if the surgery if done at the recommended age, is a low risk <1% ( less than one in a hundred people will be found to have an early cancer)\\nHeading: Recovery\\n- After surgery you may experience muscular pain which can be controlled using paracetamol and anti-inflammatory medications. Rarely you experience shoulder pain due to irritation of the abdominal lining, however this will usually be gone within a day.\\n- Most people are mobile and able to engage in normal activities the day after their surgery. If you are working you may require 1-2 week off work. Recovery may be longer if more complicated surgery is needed. Your surgeon will discuss specific recovery recommendations with you.\\n- Other more strenuous activities such as heavy lifting, driving and exercise can be returned to approximately a week following surgery.\\n- A follow up appointment with your surgeon to discuss your pathology results is usually arranged for about 6 weeks after the surgery.\\nHeading: Ovarian cancer screening is not recommended\\n- There is no reliable method to screen for ovarian cancer\\n- Transvaginal ultrasounds can detect ovarian cancer but not reliably at an early stage when treatment is more effective\\nHeading: Issues to consider regarding RRSO\\n- Symptoms of ovarian cancer are non-specific which makes it difficult to diagnose at an early stage\\n- The decision to undertake RRSO is personal and you should discuss the advantages and disadvantages of RRSO with a specialist before undergoing surgery.\\n- RRSO will result in the immediate onset of menopause if you have not yet been through this. SeeHow to prepare for menopause\\n- It is normal to have concerns about issues such as onset of menopause symptoms, body image, impacts on sexuality and femininity, when considering RRSO.\\n- It is important, if you are concerned to discuss these with your surgeon, and support network, and to weigh up your concerns again the risk reduction benefit of RRSO.\\n- It is not unusual to experience anxiety.

These may also return at different times in your life. Your result may also bring back grief and concern about other family members. It is normal to feel anxious, upset, or even angry that you have this gene fault and it can take time to accept that this is part of who you are. Some people adapt quicker than others; this is also normal. Finding the right support at the right time can make a difference.\\nHeading: Creating a Support Toolkit\\nMental health experts suggest that everyone should create a personal ‘Support Toolkit’ to help with life challenges. A toolkit contains different strategies that you know work for you, when you have experienced a challenging time in the past. Stress or sadness can often prevent you identifying or remembering things that you enjoy or bring meaning to your life. In your toolkit, actively collect tools from various sources that you can easily take out and use to cope with what is causing stress. Some suggestions include:\\n- Identifying healthy lifestyle factors that you know you enjoy like specific exercises, walks or hobbies, specific foods you like, and opportunities to laugh.\\n- Identify people and relationships (family or friends) who will support you in a way that you find helpful\\n- It might also be helpful to think about how you coped with a challenging situation in the past. You may be able to apply some of the same techniques or strategies to your current problem.\\n- Some stress can be caused by uncertainty, so contact your GP or a FCC for information on how to manage uncertainty.If these approaches do not help you, speak to your GP about obtaining professional support. For more long-term support, psychological support with a psychologist or psychiatrist may be helpful.You deserve a good quality of life.\\nHeading: Common emotions and feelings\\nEveryone’s experience is different but listed below are some common emotions women like you have reported feeling at different points in their lives:1,2\\nHeading: Anxiety\\nFinding out that you have a BRCA gene fault can lead to you having an increased level of worry about your cancer risks. This distress may be a result of one or a combination of:\\n- Feelings of uncertainty\\n- Screening anxiety\\n- Concerns for own health\\n- Experience of illness with other family members\\n- Decisions about care and family pressures\\n- Decision making surrounding risk-reducing surgery\\n- Anger or guilt about other family members\\n- Loss of control\\n- Feeling alone or isolatedAny or all of these stressors are completely normal and may appear at different time points. If you are struggling to cope, think about contacting your doctor, specialist or Familial Cancer Centre to receive some further support.\\nHeading: Guilt\\n- You might be feeling guilty about potentially passing this gene on to your biologically-related children.\\n- Remember you cannot control the genes you inherit from your biologically-related parents or the ones you pass on to your biologically-related children.\\n- You may also see it as important information available for other family members to protect them from developing a cancer or identify a cancer in its early stages.\\n- People can also feel “survivor guilt” – guilt that they did not inherit the gene fault and were spared the fate of other relatives.\\n- Contact your Familial Cancer Centre to discuss how you are feeling and the impact the result can have on you and your family.\\nHeading: Grief\\nLoss is a profound feeling and it can be very difficult to deal with it. Feelings of sadness or grief are a common reaction to experiencing a loss, such as:\\n- Losing family members to cancer or\\n- Losing the feeling of normal lifeGrief is a normal reaction to such a loss, however, if these feelings are prolonged or impacting on your daily functions, please seek professional help from GP or other doctor.

It doesn’t necessarily mean you have anxiety or depression if you experience some of these symptoms occasionally. If these symptoms are ongoing or starting to affect other areas of life, like relationships or work, you should speak to someone such as a trusted friend or family member, a GP, therapist, or psychologist about potential treatment.\\nHeading: Support\\nHeading: Peer support\\nYou may find it helpful to read stories from or talk to other people with a gene fault.1You can find a number of online support services both in Australia and internationally that can provide peer support including but not limited to:\\n- Pink Hope:https://www.pinkhope.org.au/- provides programs and support services to empower high risk women and their families\\n- Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE):http://www.facingourrisk.org/- connects cancer survivors, people at high risk and their caregivers to support and resources personalized for their situation\\n- Cancer Council Australia– have trained support volunteers and share personal stories.

Even if you have close friends and a supportive family, you may feel the need for further psychological support. Sometimes you may still feel like you are struggling, even when you use up your entire toolkit. This is the time to seek further professional advice. Talking about these issues with healthcare professionals sooner rather than later, will help you adjust or recover your health1. See your doctor, high-risk specialist, or familial cancer centre for a referral to a self-led counselling tool, psychologist, mental health counsellor, or psychiatrist. Someone who specialises in mental health can discuss different options and/or ongoing support for you. TheMental health care and Medicare webpageis provided by the Australian Government. This will tell you what your options are, what you are entitled to and what costs or claims you may need to make.It is important to remember there is always help available – either online, by phone, or face-to-face.\\nIf you are in crisis and need support, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

Give yourself time to adjust to changes, look after your body, and take your recovery at your own pace.You may find yourself in need of additional support following the risk-reducing removal of your breast tissue. Particularly as sometimes it can be challenging to find information on your own about what it is like after   risk reducing bilateral mastectomy(RRBM). Here are some issues people like you have sought support for at different time points1:\\n\\nHeading: Look and feel of your breasts\\nRRBM is very different to a breast augmentation because the surgeon removes all of your breast tissue. Initially after the surgery, you will experience bruising, swelling and vivid scars and may be shocked at the appearance of your breasts. The look of your breasts will improve over time as:\\n- the bruising and swelling improve\\n- your breasts ‘settle’ into their new positionSkin quality and wound healing will affect how well the scars fade. Try moisturisers, oil and massage.\\nBody image and gender identity\\n- You may find differences in how you feel about your body.\\n- If you choose to have a reconstruction,  y ou may feel as if your reconstructed breasts are not your own and may experience sadness at the loss of your natural breasts.\\nSensationFollowing bilateral mastectomy, you may find you have little sensation left in your breasts.\\nHeading: Relationships\\nHeading: Communicating with family about your surgery\\nLike communicating your genetic test results to family members,you may be worried to tell family and friends about your decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. Support from family and friends forms an important part of healing emotionally. Share the burden both before and after deciding to go ahead with the surgery by talking to others and sharing your feelings with trusted people, as much as you usually feel comfortable to do so.\\nHeading: Communicating with others (colleagues, friends, etc) about your surgery\\nWith time off and possible changed appearance, you may find that friends or work colleagues ask questions that you may or may not be comfortable answering. Consider setting a boundary for each sphere of people (work, friends, close friends/family) with what has happened to manage those situations, to avoid feeling as if you have over-revealed or said something too personal.\\nHeading: Intimate relationships\\nYou may be feeling anxious deciding if and when to tell intimate partners about your surgery and gene fault. People like you have found that sharing this information generally has a positive effect on the relationship and facilitates a greater degree of intimacy.2\\nHeading: Setting realistic expectations\\nDealing with the process, recovery and outcomes of risk-reducing surgery requires a good understanding and psychological preparation.3Your breast surgeon will discuss with you what they recommend as the best options for you. Feel free to ask your breast specialist about possible appearance, pain, discomfort, and recovery time concerns before your surgery. You may also ask for photos with a range of outcomes to prepare you for what your breasts may look and feel like. Your expectations may differ from those of another woman. It is important to continue to communicate with your specialist and others in your care team (familial cancer centre, breast care nurse, etc) as needed. Risk-reducing surgery may not reduce or entirely remove your cancer worry. Talk to your care team if you find you still have concerns about your risk. Often, surgeons will suggest or request a pre-operative psychological assessment to ensure you have considered the psychological, practical and social impact of the risk-reducing surgery.\\nPlanningYou may find it helpful to gather as much information as possible before the surgery.Reducing your breast cancer risk with surgeryand the below listed resources can help you plan physically and emotionally for your surgery. If you don’t know where to start, contact your local Familial Cancer Centre or your doctor who can guide you in the right direction.\\nHeading: Support\\nHeading: Family and friends\\nYou should consider engaging a support system when considering a risk-reducing mastectomy. This includes:\\n- Identifying a person to provide physical support immediately post-surgery is important to help you. You will need help with day-to-day things like preparing meals and going to the bathroom.\\n- You may find that being unable to do things on your own can take an emotional toll. Having someone to talk to and give you words of encouragement can support you mentally during this time.\\n- It may also be helpful to prepare some hobbies or tasks that you can do during your recovery.\\n- Ensure these hobbies are within the recommended physical limitations.\\nHeading: Professional support\\nEven if you have close friends and a supportive family, you may feel the need for further psychological support. If your support needs persist, you may consider accessing help from professionals. To find out more, speak to your breast specialist, breast care nurse, doctor or GP who can also refer you to see a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist, or a sexual health counsellor.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

Evidence shows that those who feel anxious or mood symptoms at the time of the operation do not adjust as well. Remember to seek help sooner rather than later if you find yourself in need of additional support. Here are a number of things people like you have sought support for at different time points:\\nAdjusting to the impact of surgical menopause1,2,3\\n- Physical side effects like hot flushes and change in mood can make you uncomfortable or unhappy\\n- Sleep deprivation or insomnia\\nBody image and gender identityYou may find differences in how you feel about your body.\\nLoss of libido or impaired sexual function which can affect your relationshipIt is unclear how much this results from persistent discomfort during sexual activity due to vaginal dryness, and how much is due to loss of desire, interest and pleasure.

With the collaboration of your healthcare team, there are ways to manage an increased cancer risk while still ensuring that you are able to access the necessary support and management needed.

Therefore it is important to inform them too as there are health implications for them to consider (seeLess Common Cancers).\\n- Genetic clinics or other medical specialists cannot contact your family members directly due to issue of confidentiality.\\n- Remember that the gene fault does not cause an increased risk of cancers in childhood and there are no genetic tests or screening recommended for people under the age of 18.\\nHeading: Recommendation\\nHeading: Informing adult family members about genetic testing and cancer risk \\n- You are best placed to share the information with your family and while you may feel anxious or sad about doing this, please remember there are many benefits for them in having the information.\\n- You may want to gauge your family member’s interest and readiness to hear the information prior to setting up a meeting.\\n- Prepare for the conversation with clear, calm and accurate information. Set aside time for the conversation and ensure that you are in a comfortable and private setting.\\n- Family members may respond in different way to the information. Surprise, shock and, even anger are common responses but are usually short lived. Think about how you will respond to these reactions and how you might feel as well.\\n- There are resources to assist you in having these conversations.\\n- Usually, Clinical Genetics services provide a letter outlining the information for you to share with your family.\\n- Allow family members time to absorb information and to come back and talk to you later. They can also contact a genetics clinic, their GP, or a breast cancer specialist for more information\\n- Remember the way family members respond is beyond your control. You can pass on the information, and direct them to health professionals for further discussion and support.\\n- Also understand that having these conversations might affect you and think about where you can get support such as from your GP or counsellor.\\n- You can find more information and resources on the following websites:https://www.genetics.edu.au/PDF/Pamphlet-Talking%20to%20your%20family%20about%20genetic%20diagnosis%20or%20test%20result-CGE.pdfandhttps://www.eviq.org.au/patients-and-carers/patient-information-sheets/3216-informing-family-members-about-hereditary-can\\nHeading: Helping family members access genetic testing\\n- The location of the gene fault is specific to each family. Think of it like a spelling mistake in a textbook so providing your relative with a copy of your genetic test result may be helpful.\\n- In order for family members to access genetic testing for themselves, they may ask where you had your testing.\\n- Genetic services frequently communicate with each other and they may confidentially share genetic test results, which explains scientifically where the gene fault location is, if you have provided consent.\\nHeading: Speaking to young family members about genetic testing\\n- When to tell your children and other young family   members about genetic testingis a question that many parents struggle with.\\n- There are a number of internet resources you can access to help you including:http://familyties.org.au/conversation-fact-sheets/communicating-with-young-people-about-genetic-cancer-risk/\\n- Reasons which may help in deciding when to discuss genetic risk with them include;\\n- reaching an age where genetic testing becomes available (after age 18 years, ideally around 25 years old)\\n- seeing you or other family members make decisions about testing or risk management,\\n- asking questions about their own family history and what this means for them.\\n- Asking the young person what they already know, or checking what they understand is helpful.\\n- Be honest and available to answer their questions. The young person should know that it is ok to talk about it and ask questions.\\n- Use age appropriate language. Pictures can also be helpful.\\n- Reassure the young person that they are safe and there are no tests that they have to do.\\nHeading: Considerations\\nHeading: Insurance\\nSome people may have been put off from having a genetic test because of concerns the results of the test may exclude them from obtaining insurance cover. A moratorium put in place in Australia in June 2019 ensures people can access a level of life insurance without being asked about their genetic testing result. This is currently planned to be re-evaluated in mid-2024. See thisfact sheet from the Financial Services Councilfor further information.\\nHeading: Seek advice and support\\nConsider seeking more advice and support from a specialist, such as a genetic counsellor, or your GP before you approach or sit down with your family.

As your gene fault can also be passed onto any biological children, this can also be relevant in your reproductive planning.Exploring topics such as timing of pregnancies, ways in which you can preserve your fertility and options for reproductive genetic testing can support your planning and help to reduce concerns. Fertility specialists and reproductive genetic counsellors can provide information and recommendations to support your reproductive choices.\\nHeading: Contraception methods and effectiveness\\nThere is no singular recommended method of contraception for people with a gene fault. Contraception is a personal choice and it is essential you use birth control safely. You should talk with your doctor to access the most suitable and effective method of contraception for you and your lifestyle.\\nHormonal contraception methods\\n- These include contraceptives such as the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), implants, hormonal intrauterine devices (IUD), or vaginal ring.\\n- There is evidence that suggests taking hormonal contraceptives appears to slightly increase your risk of breast cancer1,2\\n- This is for all women and people with breast tissue, not just those with a gene fault\\n- Throughout your life, this risk is low. Taking hormonal contraceptives should not significantly affect your chances of developing breast cancer\\n- Use a low dose OCP, and avoid progesterone only intrauterine devices3\\n- Some evidence suggests that taking OCP lowers your risk of developing ovarian cancer by 30-40%4.\\nNon-hormonal contraception methods\\n- These include barriers (diaphragm, condoms, etc) or copper IUD and are not associated with an increased cancer risk.\\n- Some metal IUDs may impact MRI screening so check with your breast specialist if you are thinking of getting an IUD.\\nHeading: Planning a pregnancy\\nTiming of pregnancy\\n- Fertility declines naturally with age. It is generally recommended that if you are planning to carry a pregnancy and are in a position to do this, then proceed with your plans as early as is feasible.\\n- Where possible, plan pregnancies to allow breast screening before you become pregnant.\\n- Risk-reducing mastectomywill stop you being able to breastfeed. Consider the timing of your pregnancies if you are intending to have this surgery.\\nOptimising fertility\\n- If you have been trying to become pregnant for 6 months with no success, or have other infertility risks (i.e. age, irregular menstrual cycles or other known predisposing factors) then a consultation with an IVF doctor may be appropriate.\\n- SeeFertilityfor further information.\\nHeading: Considerations for biologically related children\\nEach biologically related child you have now or in the future has a 50% chance of inheriting your gene fault. As there are no associated childhood or adolescent risks associated with BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2, they can seek testing in adulthood should they wish to clarify this further.\\nReproductive genetic testing\\n- You can also test your baby during pregnancy to tell whether the baby has the gene fault or not to inform pregnancy decisions. You should talk to a prenatal genetic counsellor if you are considering this option.\\n- Pre-implantation Genetic Testing (PGT) - is an IVF technique used to test embryos for specific gene faults (including BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2) prior to implantation and pregnancy. You should talk to a reproductive genetic counsellor at an IVF service if you are considering this option.SeeReproductive genetic testingfor further information.\\nHeading: Resources\\n1.

However, breast screening is more difficult during pregnancy.\\n- Hormone changes during pregnancy cause the breasts to change and you may find your breasts become larger, lumpier, or tender.\\n- Any abnormal lump or concern during pregnancy needs to be reviewed by a doctor.\\n- There are limitations to breast screening when you are either pregnant or breastfeeding.\\n- You cannot have a breast MRI if you are pregnant or breast feeding and this needs to be considered when deciding how long to breast feed for.\\n- An ultrasound or clinical examination may be more appropriate.[caption id=\"attachment_223\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]Cancer on Ultrasound[/caption]\\nHeading: Considerations\\n- Talk to your breast specialist before starting to conceive to make a surveillance plan.\\n- If you are pregnant, talk to your breast specialist to work out what breast screening is most appropriate for you.'), Document(metadata={'id': '61', 'topic': 'Fertility', 'gene': 'All', 'min_age': 20, 'max_age': 100}, page_content='Min Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nHeading: Recommendations\\n- If you do not have clear plans to consider a pregnancy, or you want to ensure that you will have the option in the future, you may wish to explore fertility preservation options.\\n- There are implications to consider, and you should consult with a fertility doctor if you are interested in hearing more.\\nHeading: Fertility Preservation\\nFertility preservation is used to increase the chance of somebody having children in future. It can be used for medical reasons and personal circumstances\\n- If you are single or wanting to keep future options open and are considering having children in the future, you may wish to consider egg freezing.\\n- This involves cryogenically freezing eggs taken from your ovaries. The cryopreserved eggs can be thawed and utilised through IVF techniques at a later stage if needed.\\n- If you do have a partner, and are considering having children together in the future, you may wish to consider embryo freezing.\\n- This involves eggs first being fertilized with sperm using IVF techniques. After a few days’ development, they become embryos which are then frozen and can be individually thawed and implanted at a later stage if needed.\\nHeading: Infertility\\nFertility specialists can advise you on options to improve your chance of a pregnancy if needed. These include:\\nHeading: Fertility health check\\nThis can be undertaken to help understand the cause of infertility and includes ovulation testing and tracking, pelvic ultrasounds, blood tests, and semen analysis.\\nHeading: Ovulation induction\\nThis can be used if your doctor feels that you are not ovulating regularly or at all. The medications increase the production of eggs in the ovaries to improve the chance of conception.\\nHeading: Assisted reproductive techniques (ART)\\n There are a number of techniques which can be used including: \\n-  Assisted insemination (AI) -This involves insertion of semen through the cervix and into the uterus at or just before the time of ovulation. AI can be performed during a natural menstrual cycle, or in combination with ovulation induction. \\n-  In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) – IVF involves taking eggs and sperm and combining them in a culture dish. If fertilisation occurs and an embryo develops, the embryo is then placed into the uterus in\\u202fa procedure called an\\u202fembryo transfer. Sometimes multiple embryos may develop, and they can be frozen for use in later transfer procedures. The chance of getting pregnant at the end of an IVF cycle is around 30-45% per embryo transferred, depending on age and fertility considerations.  Medicare and private health insurance will cover a large amount of the cost of ART, however there are still out-of-pocket costs. These costs will vary depending on the IVF provider you choose. \\nIf you are concerned about your fertility, there are reproductive options available to help you.These can be used to assist you to conceive a child as your fertility (the ability to get pregnant) decreases. Your peak reproductive years are between the late teens and late 20s. By age 30 years, fertility starts to decline. This decline becomes more rapid from age 37 years, and it is very difficult to become pregnant naturally after the age of 45 years.'), Document(metadata={'id': '62', 'topic': 'Reproductive Genetic Testing', 'gene': 'All', 'min_age': 20, 'max_age': 100}, page_content='Min Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nThere are a number of reproductive genetic testing options available that can allow you to have biological children who do not inherit your gene fault. This can be achieved through genetic testing in pregnancy or in embryos prior to pregnancy.\\xa0 Genetic counselling is important to ensure you are fully informed about your reproductive options for your individual situation and the associated benefits, risks, and limitations. \\nHeading: Prenatal Diagnostic (PND)\\nPrenatal diagnosis is a diagnostic genetic test in pregnancy to determine if the developing foetus has inherited a gene fault present in either the biological mother or father.\\n- To perform a diagnostic test, a sample of the placenta or amniotic fluid is required as this contains DNA from the developing foetus.\\n- There are two different procedures – chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis - available at different time points in pregnancy. Both involve inserting a long thin needle through the abdomen to obtain the sample. There is a small risk of miscarriage associated with each procedure.\\n- Your obstetrician or doctor will be able to advise which procedure is the most appropriate for you. Prenatal genetic counsellors can also be accessed before any procedure is performed and to discuss the genetic test results with you.\\n- Depending on the gene fault being tested for, the results may take up to two weeks to be available. There can be out of pocket expenses for this type of genetic testing.\\nHeading: Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) \\nPreimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) is a reproductive genetic testing option for individuals at risk of passing on a specific gene fault (such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2) to their biological child.\\n- PGT involves genetic testing on embryos created using IVF techniques to determine which embryos have not inherited the gene fault\\n- The first step towards PGT is called feasibility, which involves designing a genetic test specific for your gene fault to perform on the embryos using DNA from you, your partner and sometimes other family members.\\n- Once a test is feasible, IVF techniques are used to create embryos. When the embryo reaches Day 5-6 in development, a few cells are removed (embryo biopsy) to perform the genetic test\\n- Embryos can also be screened to identify whether the correct number of chromosomes are present. Errors in the early development of sperm, egg or embryo can lead to an abnormal number of chromosomes in a developing embryo and the chance of this occurring increase as you get older. Chromosomally abnormal embryos will fail to implant, miscarry, or result in the birth of a child with a chromosome abnormality.\\n- Only embryos that have not inherited the gene fault and have the correct number of chromosomes are suitable to be used to achieve a pregnancy.\\n- PGT is NOT 100% accurate. Confirmatory prenatal diagnosis is highly recommended if a pregnancy is achieved following PGT.\\n- Medicare rebates are available for feasibility and for genetic testing of embryos although there can often still be some out-of-pocket expenses.An IVF specialist and reproductive genetic counsellor will be able to discuss this with you further.\\nHeading: Additional reproductive options\\n Through assisted reproduction techniques such as IVF, donated eggs, sperm, or embryos can also be accessed that can enable you to have children who have not inherited your gene fault.\\xa0 This may be an option to consider if other underlying fertility issues mean you are unable to use your own egg or sperm to achieve a pregnancy. Another option that can enable someone to have children who have not inherited their gene fault, and if they do not want to consider options related to ART is to instead consider adoption.'), Document(metadata={'id': '63', 'topic': 'Grief Support', 'gene': 'All', 'min_age': 20, 'max_age': 100}, page_content='Min Age: 20\\nMax Age: 100\\n\\nThis module provides further information on grief and loss with some helpful resources. It will talk about two different types of grief: the grief of testing positive to a gene fault and bereavement where you may have had a loved one die from cancer.1\\nIf you are in crisis and need support, call Lifeline on 13 11 14 or GriefLine on 1300 845 745.\\nHeading: What is grief?\\nGrief is a normal response to any loss. It involves adjusting to life without the person who has died. There are other types of grief, including anticipatory grief, which involves grieving for a future loss.2Further information can be found atAustralian Centre for Grief and Bereavement(ACGB). There is no right or wrong way to grieve, no set time period and the grief may never go away completely. Sometimes the pain of loss can feel overwhelming, but, with support and understanding, you will find a way forward.\\nHeading: Grief and cancer predisposing gene faults\\nBecause of the inherited nature of gene faults, it is likely that you have had a family member who has died following a cancer diagnosis. Here are some resources surrounding grief and cancer that may be helpful for you:\\n- Cancer Council -https://www.cancervic.org.au/living-with-cancer/grief/grief-overview.html\\n- Cancer.Net -https://www.cancer.net/coping-with-cancer/managing-emotions/grief-and-lossReceiving a genetic test result, going for screening or undergoing a risk reducing procedure can trigger grief that you may have thought you had previously dealt with.1Reach out to a family member or friend, your breast specialist, doctor, or Familial Cancer Centre if you want to talk through this further.\\nHeading: Support\\nYou may be feeling alone and finding it difficult to make sense of the grief in your life. Everyone reacts differently and what you are feeling is normal.Do not judge yourself harshly as grief is not a weakness but a sign of how important that person was to you. It is important that you get the support and help you need. It may also be helpful to:\\n- Talk with people or reading the stories of people who have had similar experiences and can understand your feelings.\\n- Talk with someone else in your family who has the BRCA gene fault as they may be experiencing something similar to you.\\n- SeeSupportive Carefor more suggestions\\nHeading: Supporting someone else\\n- When someone you care about is grieving after a loss, it can be difficult to know what to say or do.\\n- Don’t let fears about saying or doing the wrong thing stop you from reaching out.\\n- Let the person know you are there to listen.\\n- Ask the person what help would be useful to them or offer to help in practical ways.\\n- Understand that everyone grieves differently and for different lengths of time.\\n- For more information:https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/servicesandsupport/grief-how-to-support-the-bereavedhttps://www.helpguide.org/articles/grief/helping-someone-who-is-grieving.htm\\nHeading: Professional support\\n- Even if you have close friends and a supportive family, you may feel the need for further psychological support.\\n- See your doctor, high-risk specialist, or familial cancer centre for a discussion and potential referral to a psychologist, mental health counsellor, or psychiatrist. Someone who specialises in mental health can discuss different options and/or ongoing support for you.\\n- There are also a number of professional counselling and support telephone, SMS and video service resources includingGriefLine\\n- TheMental health care and Medicare webpageis provided by the Australian Government.
